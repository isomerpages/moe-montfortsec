Dear Parents/ Guardians

1) We warmly welcome your son/ward and you to the Montfortian family!

2) As your son/ward embarks on his new journey in Montfort, it is our pleasure to start him off with a fun-filled and meaningful Orientation organised by his seniors to make new friends and learn more about the school.

3) CCA experiences for the Clubs & Societies, Performing Arts and Uniformed Groups are weaved into the Orientation programme in the first week. Trials for Sports CCAs take place on a sign-up basis in the afternoons of the second week. More information on CCA experiences and trials will be briefed to your son/ward in the first week.

4) Please feel free to contact the following personnel should you have queries about Secondary One matters, Orientation matters or CCA matters.
