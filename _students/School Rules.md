<p>Every Montfortian is expected to have a high level of self-discipline
and social responsibility at all times. He understands that discipline
is at the centre of all we do and that the purpose of school is to learn
– not just academic subjects but also to learn what appropriate behaviour
is and to be able to discern right from wrong.</p>
<p>The adherence to school rules and regulations helps build a school and
classroom environment that is safe and conducive for learning. Disciplinary
systems and measures are put in place to enable students to understand
what is expected of them and to understand the consequences of both positive
and negative behaviour.</p>
<p>All students need to adhere to the school rules and in particular ensure
that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Being clean shaven e.g. All male students must be clean-shaven at all
times. Moustache and beards are not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to
the uniform is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist placed
over the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon. They
are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is intended to
be used to cause harm to others.</p>
