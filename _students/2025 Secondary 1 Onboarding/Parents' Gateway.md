##### <u>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PARENTS/GUARDIANS</u>

1. Important school information and announcement will be put up on the school website.
2. If there are necessary and urgent updates, the school administration will communicate with parents/guardians via MOE Parents Gateway (PG). 
3. Please download and install PG app from App Store or Google Play onto your mobile smartphone. This will be the primary platform for communication with parents and guardians.
