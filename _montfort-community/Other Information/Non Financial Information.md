<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Montfort Secondary School, established in 1916, is a Government Aided
School of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel under the Catholic Archdiocese
of Singapore.&nbsp; As a Catholic school, we espouse the Universal Gospel
Values and are committed to providing an inclusive, safe and dynamic environment
for all our boys regardless of faith and background.&nbsp; We also believe
that there is a place for an all-boys education and we develop and cater
our programmes to the needs of boys - giving them appropriate structure
and discipline as well as the space to grow and discover their leadership,
talents and strengths.</p>
<p>Our School Motto "Age Quod Agis" translates to "Do Well in Whatever you
Do".&nbsp; It reminds our boys of the dignity of work and that the work
they do is important, and represents who they are.&nbsp; Therefore, they
need to take pride in their assigned tasks and do them to the best of their
abilities.&nbsp; Our School Values are Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity,
Service, Team Spirit &amp; Excellence - together they spell CHRISTE which
also represents our faith in God and Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
</p>
<p>A Man for Others â€“ a Scholar, a Sportsman, a Gentleman and a Leader.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong>
</p>
<p>Montfort is a Catholic School. Guided by our Montfortian Values and Spirituality,
we nurture each individual to realise his potential and inspire him to
be a Man for Others</p>
<p><strong>Programmes/Activities:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underlying Montfort Secondary School's teaching and learning approach
is the belief that boys learn better when we adopt Boy-Centric Teaching
(BCT) strategies. Translated into classroom delivery, this would mean that
teachers now incorporate novelty, movement and relevance into their lessons.
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Information Systems Technology
&amp; Design aims to provide our students with foundational skills in this
frontier learning domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of leadership and character is another vital part of our
Montfortian Education.&nbsp; We do this through our flagship Montfortian
Values Plus (MVP) programme and supported by a tiered Values-in-Action
Programme for our boys from Sec 1 to 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is centred on Leadership Development
through Sports (Badminton, Softball, Football, Wushu, Rugby &amp; Basketball)
&amp; Outdoor Education, where our boys hone their leadership skills through
various class, CCA and community projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our Catholic boys, the programmes catered for them include Religious
and Moral Education lessons and regular Eucharistic celebrations.&nbsp;
The school also provides opportunities for the students to appreciate the
Arts through our 3 "E" Approach (Exposure, Expression &amp; Excellence).</p>
