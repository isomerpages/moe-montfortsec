---
The School Vision, Mission, Motto and Values are common with our brother school, Montfort Junior School.

The journey towards having a common set of statements began as early as 2008 and these statements were finalised by the end of 2009.

Since then, both Montfort Junior and Secondary share the same set of Vision, Mission, Motto and Value statements. We believe that these statements are important foundations to both our schools, providing a ten-year Montfortian educational experience to every young boy, who joins us at the age of six and graduates at 16 or 17 years of age.

We also recognise that each school has its own set of more immediate challenges. Hence, at the level of strategic thrusts, both schools have their own strategies to better respond to the needs of their students and present contexts.
