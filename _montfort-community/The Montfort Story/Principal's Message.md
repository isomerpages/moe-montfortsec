    <td>Welcome to Montfort Secondary School. <br><br>As a Catholic, all-boys, mission school, every boy who comes to us is a gift and duty God has placed under our charge. In the Montfortian education we offer, character and values formation is the cornerstone on which we build the child to be a Scholar, Sportsman, Gentleman, Leader, and ultimately, a Man for Others. Our curricular and co-curricular programmes have been reviewed to emphasise the building of stronger student confidence, catering for greater student voices, and greater empowering of students in exercising their agency with responsibility and conviction. We will continue to enhance our curricular and co-curricular offerings to help our students achieve personal success, and at the same time, imbue in them the value of other-centredness and find fulfilment in their service of others.<br><br>Our school has a long and illustrious history. Throughout the course of our rich history, the fundamental principle for our students to live their lives by has remained unchanged, and is codified in our school motto,<br><br>
			<em>Age Quod Agis</em> - Do well in whatever you do.</td>
