**The Montfortian Legacy**

Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716) lived at a time of transition. It was a time of discoveries, both of new lands and in science. A spirit of enquiry and adventure reigned supreme. Montfort, a man of great vitality, indomitable courage and spiritual strength was a seeker after the only treasure that mattered: Divine Wisdom. He gave himself up to the ways of Wisdom and in the process developed a pedagogy of acquiring true Wisdom that not only guided his own inner journey but also the lives of all those he touched.

Montfort sought to lead the world around him in the ways of such wisdom, beginning with the poorest, the lost and the least. He did so in different ways as in ‘charity schools’ for the young, mass education using his great oratorical skills, collective social action, and writing scholarly volumes, popular tracts, poems and letters.

  

The purpose of education according to Montfort is threefold:

*   To learn, understand and love God as Wisdom  
    
*   To understand and transform oneself in the ways of Wisdom  
    
*   To become committed to transform society in obedience to Wisdom  
    
*   These remain the purpose and goal of the Montfortian education.  
    

  

**Vision Statement**

Montfortian Education has the person in society at its centre. It transforms individuals and communities to be spiritually inspired, respect the community of life, be fraternal in orientation, and just in all relationships. The goal of Montfortian education is to form enlightened and harmonious persons committed to a just and fraternal world.

  

**Mission Statement**

Inspired to the mission of Jesus to proclaim the good news to the poor, liberty to captives, sight to the blind, and to set at liberty those who are oppressed (Lk.4:18-19), Montfortian education in its different forms is committed to the empowerment of youth, particularly the poor (C 89), and all those struggling for justice (C 92). It seeks transformation and self-realisation of the person at the intellectual, moral, spiritual and social levels to be able to contribute to the world in its quest for respect for the community of life, longing for just and fraternal relationships, and attaining sustainable development.
