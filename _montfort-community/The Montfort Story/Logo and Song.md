The centerpiece of the school crest is the Coat of Arms, which has quadrants. The crest is adorned with green olive branches to symbolise peace and prosperity. It is the duty of each one to promote peace in the world, a peace that will last.</td>

The crest carries the Brothers of St Gabriel motto ‘LABOR OMNIA VINCIT’ which stands for ‘Labour conquers all things’.

  

Hard work, embodied in diligence and perseverance, leads one to achieve great things in life.

  

The derivation is Montfort School’s motto ‘AGE QUOD AGIS’ or to ‘Do well in whatever you do.’
