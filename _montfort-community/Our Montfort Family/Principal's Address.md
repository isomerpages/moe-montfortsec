<p>Rooted in faith and guided by a rich educational tradition, Montfort Secondary
has, over its 110-year history, nurtured generations of young men to grow
in wisdom, character, and service. In Montfortian spirit, education in
our school is grounded in a deep respect for the worth and dignity of every
person.</p>
<p>Years after leaving school, many of our alumni continue to hold fond memories
of their time here and remain connected in various ways. Together with
parents, partners, Catholic archdiocese and School Management Committee,
they form a strong and supportive community that embodies the Montfortian
ideal of fraternity and shared responsibility. It is both my pleasure and
privilege to lead this school.</p>
<p>As an educator, I believe that the educational experience is as important
as educational outcomes. While new knowledge and skills are acquired at
each stage of learning, real growth lies in the formation of the heart
and mind — in the attitudes, values, and interests that shape a young person’s
outlook on life.</p>
<p>Every student entrusted to our care possesses unique gifts and immense
potential and the school plays a vital role in helping each boy develop
moral clarity, courage, and a sense of responsibility, so that he can make
choices that are informed, principled, and mindful of the wider community.
The mastery of intellectual and life skills is integral to this formation.</p>
<p>Indeed, as our motto Age Quod Agis reminds us, we call our students to
do well in all that they undertake, to act with integrity, and to give
their best in every situation.</p>
<p>If you are already part of our school community, know that you belong
to a Christ-centred environment that seeks to care for, guide, and nurture
you. If you are not yet part of our family, we warmly invite you to journey
with us.</p>
