<p>Warmest Greetings and welcome to Montfort Secondary School!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since 1916, Montfort Secondary School has heeded the call to nurture each
Montfortian to realise his potential and inspire him to be a Man for Others
– Scholar, Sportsman, Gentleman, Leader. We share the same mission as Montfort
Junior School and are an integral part of the Montfortian Gabrielite Education
Institutions and the Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Standing at 109 years old, our school is a testimony of God’s faithfulness
through the generations. We are anchored on our school values of Compassion,
Humility, Respect, Integrity, Service, Team Spirit &amp; Excellence. Together,
these values spell CHRISTE which represents our faith in God and Christ.</p>
<p>Together with our School Management Committee, alumni, parents and staff
we continue to be steadfast to our commitment of enriching the lives of
our Montfortians and preparing them for the future through the rich curricular
and co-curricular experiences and the varied learning spaces. Our school
motto “Age Quod Agis” which means “Do Well In Whatever You Do” serves to
inspire our boys to be a living testimony to live a life worthy of their
calling, and to be a blessing to those around them and the world.
