    <td>Welcome to Montfort Secondary School. <br><br>As a Catholic, all-boys, mission school, every boy who comes to us is a gift and duty God has placed under our charge. In the Montfortian education we offer, character and values formation is the cornerstone on which we build the child to be a Scholar, Sportsman, Gentleman, Leader, and ultimately, a Man for Others. Our curricular and co-curricular programmes have been reviewed to emphasise the building of stronger student confidence, catering for greater student voices, and greater empowering of students in exercising their agency with responsibility and conviction. We will continue to enhance our curricular and co-curricular offerings to help our students achieve personal success, and at the same time, imbue in them the value of other-centredness and find fulfilment in their service of others.<br><br>Our school has a long and illustrious history. Throughout the course of our rich history, the fundamental principle for our students to live their lives by has remained unchanged, and is codified in our school motto,<br><br>
			<em>Age Quod Agis</em> - Do well in whatever you do.</td>

It is this constancy of purpose that has seen the school nurture generations of Montfortians who give back to the community and society. Through dedication and unwavering effort, the school continues to grow from strength to strength. The school’s achievements are the fruit of the commitment and industry of our past and present School Leaders, School Management Committee members, staff, students, parents and alumni.

  

Both young and senior alumni often share fondly with me stories and memories of their teachers, as though those yesteryear happenings have occurred just yesterday. Such is the positive and lasting impact Montfort teachers have on their students. Indeed, the teachers are what make Montfort Secondary School special. Academic achievements are important as they provide students with options, but it cannot be the sole purpose of education. Beyond preparing students to do well in their studies, our teachers are committed to nurturing holistic students, with an emphasis on character and values, and go the extra mile in caring for the boys. While the teachers may have come and gone, this trait of Montfort teachers remains ever constant.

  

We can be certain that there will be challenges we need to face this year, but at the same time, we are also assured and fortified by the camaraderie which members of the Montfort family share. With profound trust in God’s care, provision and protection, we enter the year with gratitude and optimism.

  

_Blessed are those who trust in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord. They shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by the stream. It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay green; in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease to bear fruit. (Jeremiah 17:7-8)_
