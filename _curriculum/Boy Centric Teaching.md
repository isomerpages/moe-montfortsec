**Boy-Centric Teaching (BCT)**

As a school deeply committed to the delivery of a quality instructional programme for our boys, a thorough understanding of what “boy-centric teaching” (BCT) entails and the consistent and persistent use of the various school-wide and department-wide pedagogical strategies and approaches by our teachers is of high importance. The clarity on BCT was crystallized through numerous lessons observations, professional conversations and deep reflection on what works and what does not and further triangulated by the extensive literature reviews done by the School Leaders and Key Personnel (i.e. Middle Managers and Senior Teachers).
