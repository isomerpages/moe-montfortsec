### Overview

Digital technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in  jobs, workplaces and society.

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready. 

The NDLP aims to equip our students with Digital Literacies. 

Digital Literacies better enable our students, at different stages of their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the **‘Find, Think, Apply and Create’** framework.

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end 2021, Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

The device will be used to facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.

### Intended Outcomes of a Personalised Learning Environment

The use of the Personal Learning Device for teaching and learning aims to:

### Funding Information

**The cost of the device bundle can be paid using your child’s Edusave account**, after setting aside provision for payment of second-tier miscellaneous fees.

To ensure the affordability of devices, there was a **one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in April 2020** to support the purchase of the device. 

This is on top of the **annual $290** credited into the Edusave account for Secondary School students.

For students on MOE-FAS, subsidies are available even if there is insufficient Edusave balance. The cash out-of-pocket will be $0. 

Subsidies will be provided for SC who need support, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4,000 or Per Capita Income (PCI)# is below $1,000.

For more details on financial assistance, please approach the school. 

Permanent residents (PR) and international students (IS) who need support could apply for subsidies, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4000 or Per Capita Income (PCI)# is below $1000. 

For more details, please approach the school. 

### Responsible Usage of PLD


The school has in place some measures to enable a safe and seamless learning environment for students. The role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support your child.

**A. Educating students on Cyber Wellness**

MOE has made significant changes to the Character and Citizenship Education. Cyber Wellness lessons will feature significantly in the CCE2021 lessons.

Topics covered in the Cyber Wellness lessons include: 
*   Cyber Use
*   Cyber Identity
*   Cyber Relationships
*   Cyber Citizenship
*   Cyber Ethics


**B. Device Management Application** 

Device management application (DMA) software will be installed on your child’s device to provide a safe learning experience for your child, and to prevent misuse of the device.

The DMA will be **funded by MOE** and will be **uninstalled from the device when the child graduates/ leaves the school.** 


**C. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**

Parents could refer to the AUP when helping to manage his/her child’s use of the PLD. The AUP will help your child to **understand the expectations** of device use to **enable a conducive learning environment**. 

It also **outlines** the **consequences** for violating the policy. 

Parents can refer to the student’s handbook for the  Acceptable Use Policy in school.
