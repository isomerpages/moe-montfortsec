<p><strong>Lower Secondary Art Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Art Programme provides students with an exciting introduction
to art making. Through a variety of hands-on lessons, students will develop
foundational skills in Still Life Drawing, Figure Sketching, Mixed Media,
Digital Drawing, Digital Photography, and Visual Art Appreciation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond technical proficiency, the programme aims to nurture students’
ability to observe, interpret, and appreciate aesthetic values found in
both nature and their daily surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning in Art extends beyond the classroom. Students participate in
learning journeys to art galleries, and attend performances and art related
events, giving them authentic exposure to Singapore’s vibrant arts scene.
These experiences foster a holistic understanding and appreciation of the
arts and aesthetics, inspiring students to make meaningful connections
between art and the world around them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s strong commitment to art education has been recognised through
its achievements at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition,
where our students received Special Mention Awards in 2018, 2022, and 2024.
These accolades are a testament to the creativity, passion, and dedication
of both our students and teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Upper Secondary Level, we focus on strengthening of skills, techniques
and the thought process of our students as well as developing familiarity
in the use of materials to enhance visual communication and individual
expression. Students are also encouraged to formulate their own visual
understanding and appreciation through the Feldman’s approach and through
an in depth Study Of Visual Arts (SOVA), which is offered as the third
O level Art Paper. This gives flexibility to students opting for a written
theory art paper. With all these artistic skills and knowledge imparted,
our students are able to approach the rigours of the O level Art Exam papers
with better understanding and expectations in delivering their ideas.</p>

<h3>D&amp;T Instructional Programme</h3>
<p>In D&amp;T, students undertake different design projects which engage
them in generating and prototyping ideas through the mind and hands. Through
the design process, they understand human needs to create possibilities
to make life better. It also develops in them skills that turn ideas into
reality, and values like mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity in the areas
of social, culture and environment.</p>

<p><em>The Design Process Model</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>In Lower Secondary, the program focuses on cultivating visual-spatial
thinking through sketching, experimenting and prototyping using appropriate
materials and basic hand tools, equipment and machines safely.&nbsp; Through
the activities, students develop confidence and pride through turning ideas
into physical objects.</p>
<p>In the 2025 D&amp;T Awards, our project was awarded a Certificate of Commendation
by the panel of judges.&nbsp; This was based not only on the students’
design skills but also their ability to draw inspiration from nature to
solve everyday problems.</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DnT.png">
</div>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>In Upper Secondary, designing and making are dealt with in greater depth
and scope.&nbsp; Students learn how to do research to understand and define
user needs, explore and develop design solutions, and prototype their ideas
using appropriate work processes.&nbsp; In the process, pupils cultivate
creative, critical and reflective thinking and develop design related dispositions
and skills.</p>

<p>• Advocate sustainable food consumption by planning and making appropriate
food choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;• Apply principles of culinary science creatively in food preparation

<h3>Music Instructional Programme</h3>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Music Programme focuses on cultivating and developing
our students’ skills and knowledge through providing them with direct experiences
in the components of Listening and Music Making. Exposure to music of different
genres helps students develop an understanding of local and global cultures,
with an awareness and appreciation of the links between music and daily
living. Our music making and performance modules involve students singing
and playing instruments with expression and accurate technique. Students
develop confidence when performing solo or in an ensemble and learn to
work collaboratively through music making.</p>
