<h3>Art Instructional Programme</h3>
<p><strong>The 3 ‘E’ Framework</strong>
<br><strong>E</strong>xposure
<br><strong>E</strong>xpression
<br><strong>E</strong>xcellence</p>
<p>Therefore, in Montfort Secondary,</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We believe the arts are for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We engage our creativity and imagination in artistic expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We celebrate artistic talent and excellence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>The lower secondary program will see students through an exciting introduction
of both 2D and 3D art-making lessons. Skills taught include Still Life
Drawing &amp; Painting, Figure Sketching, Mixed-media, Digital photography
and Visual Art Appreciation. Apart from the acquisition of the various
skills, the teaching also aims to inculcate a sense of observation, understanding,
and appreciation of aesthetic values in nature and in our living environment.</p>
<p>Learning Art does go beyond our classroom as our students are also involved
in external visitations to art galleries, performances and art events that
will give them a holistic understanding and appreciation of the arts and
aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Upper Secondary Level, we focus on strengthening of skill, techniques
and thought process of our students as well as developing familiarity in
the use of materials to enhance visual communication and individual expression.
Students are also encouraged to formulate their own visual understanding
and appreciation through the Feldman’s approach and through an in depth
Study Of Visual Arts (SOVA) which is offered as the third O level Art Paper.
This gives flexibility to students opting for a written theory art paper.
With all these artistic skills and knowledge imparted, our students are
able to approach the rigours of the and O level Art Exam papers with better
understanding and expectations in delivering their ideas across.</p>

genres help students develop an understanding of local and global cultures,
with an awareness and appreciation of the links between music and daily
living. Our music making and performance modules involve students singing
and playing instruments with expression and accurate technique. Students
develop confidence when performing solo or in an ensemble and learn to
work collaboratively through music making.</p>
