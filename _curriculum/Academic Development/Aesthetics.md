**Art (Lower Secondary)**

The lower secondary program will see students through an exciting introduction of both 2D and 3D art-making lessons. Skills taught include Still Life Drawing & Painting, Figure Sketching, Mixed-media, Digital photography and Visual Art Appreciation. Apart from the acquisition of the various skills, the teaching also aims to inculcate a sense of observation, understanding, and appreciation of aesthetic values in nature and in our living environment.

Learning Art does go beyond our classroom as our students are also involved in external visitations to art galleries, performances and art events that will give them a holistic understanding and appreciation of the arts and aesthetics.

**Criteria for Upper Secondary Art**

To ensure students are able to cope with the upper secondary art curriculum, they need to meet the following requirements:

1.  At least a “B4” in Art at Secondary 2 

  

**Art (Upper Secondary)**

At the Upper Secondary Level, we focus on strengthening of skill, techniques and thought process of our students as well as developing familiarity in the use of materials to enhance visual communication and individual expression. Students are also encouraged to formulate their own visual understanding and appreciation through the Feldman’s approach and through an in depth Study Of Visual Arts (SOVA) which is offered as the third O level Art Paper. This gives flexibility to students opting for a written theory art paper. With all these artistic skills and knowledge imparted, our students are able to approach the rigours of the and O level Art Exam papers with better understanding and expectations in delivering their ideas across.
