### Instructional Programme
The Physical Education (PE) curriculum provides for a positive movement and healthy lifestyle experience and allows our students to develop the above values.

PE enables students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

PE develops in students:

•           A range of skills through participation in regular and varied physical education experiences. These skills enable students to enjoy movement, discover interests, and achieve personal goals related to participation in physical activity.

•           Competency in movement. This provides the foundation for continual skill acquisition and facilitates future successful participation in physical activity resulting from changing life patterns.

Participation in the twice-weekly PE lessons, Cross-Country Run, Sports Carnival and Inter-House Games teaches students the Olympic values of friendship, respect and excellence while engaging in their sporting interests. The learning of at least six different physical activities such as Softball, Badminton, Football, Basketball, Handball, Tae-Kwon-Do, Running and Creative Games provides the opportunity for our boys to play some of these sports as a recreation beyond their school years, enabling them to pursue these sports as their life-long interest.
