<h3>Instructional Programme</h3>
<p>The Physical Education (PE) curriculum provides for a positive movement
and healthy lifestyle experience and allows our students to develop the
above values.</p>
<p>PE enables students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical
skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.</p>
<p>PE develops in students:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range
of skills through participation in regular and varied physical education
experiences. These skills enable students to enjoy movement, discover interests,
and achieve personal goals related to participation in physical activity.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competency
in movement. This provides the foundation for continual skill acquisition
and facilitates future successful participation in physical activity resulting
from changing life patterns.</p>
<p>Participation in the twice-weekly PE lessons, Cross-Country Run, Sports
Carnival and Inter-House Games teaches students the Olympic values of friendship,
respect and excellence while engaging in their sporting interests. The
learning of at least six different physical activities such as Softball,
Badminton, Football, Basketball, Handball, Tae-Kwon-Do, Running and Creative
Games provides the opportunity for our boys to play some of these sports
as a recreation beyond their school years, enabling them to pursue these
sports as their life-long interest.</p>
