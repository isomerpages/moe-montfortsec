<h2>Instructional Programme</h2>
<p>Our Mathematics Department strives to develop students to be self-directed
and effective problem-solvers. As professionals, the department recognises
the importance of creating a conducive environment which allows teachers
to innovate and grow professionally.</p>
<p><strong>Foundation-Building (Lower Secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>The department recognises the need for students to acquire a strong foundation
in Lower Secondary. Therefore, we have focused on several core skills which
include problem-solving skills (thinking skills and heuristics), presentation
skills and core study skills such as note-taking and skills in understanding
critical vocabulary in Mathematics. The Lower Secondary Normal Technical
students are given opportunities to acquire concepts and subject mastery
through online lessons in and outside curriculum time.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking Skills</strong>

<p>Comparing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequencing</p>

<li>
<p>Induction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spatial Visualisation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heuristics</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To give a representation, draw a diagram, make a list, use equations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make a calculated guess (guess-and-check. Look for patterns, supposition)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To go through the process (work backwards, before-after)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To change the problem (restate the problem, simplify the problem, solve
part of the problem)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reinforcement and Consolidation (Upper Secondary)</strong>
</p>
<p>The key focus of the Upper Secondary curriculum is to reinforce study
skills with greater emphasis in interpreting different types of questions.
Lower Secondary skills are also reinforced with more emphasis on assessment
requirements.</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department continues to develop strategies to enhance
students’ cognitive development. Students are often assigned authentic
tasks to help them acquire a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts
and to make sense of various mathematical ideas as well as their connections
and applications through solving real-life problems.</p>
<p>The department has also initiated several strategies to check for students’
understanding which include using manipulatives for Normal Academic and
Normal Technical students, illustrations (diagrams and mindmap), Questioning
(Bloom’s Taxonomy) and error analysis.</p>
