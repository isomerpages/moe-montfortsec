<p><strong>Curriculum Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school-based curriculum adopts the following approaches and pedagogies
and seeks to achieve the 21st Century Competencies by developing our Montfortians
to be self-directed learners, active contributors and confident individuals.
Below are some of the approaches and pedagogies adopted in our lessons:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Collaborative and Cooperative Learning strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiated teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-line teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infusion of ICT and NE into curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group project work and discussions for team building</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our curriculum aims to equip and emphasize the four major aspects of language
skills (Aural, Oral, Reading and Writing) to our students through EDGE
programme.</p>

<p>Recognising oracy as the natural foundation for language learning, our
Lower Secondary curriculum focuses more on developing oracy skills in our
students. This is complemented with systematic teaching of oral vocabulary
and sentence structures to develop students’ reading and writing skills.
As they progress to upper secondary levels, the Upper Secondary Curriculum
focuses to ensure our students are able to apply the skills they have learnt,
think critically and achieve excellence in both written and spoken forms
through communicating their ideas confidently.</p>
<p><strong>Online Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>To further enrich their learning experiences, online learning portals
like iMTL portal and Google classroom are also extensively used for classroom
learning. iMTL portal is targeted at promoting students’ interest and improve
their competencies in mother tongue language through regular self-paced
learning activities in an enriching web-based interactive environment.
Students are able to input their thoughts and express themselves online
through the hanyu pinyin input which aids them in learning oral presentation
and interactive communication with the effective use of the portal during
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>We seek to build up and nurture in Montfortians the ability to communicate
effectively in their respective Mother Tongue languages, and expose them
to numerous enrichment activities which are designed to arouse and sustain
students’ interest in language learning through ICT. ICT helps to cultivate
the habit of reading in students and trigger students’ interest to better
appreciate ethnic culture.</p>
<p>Apart from teaching through the use of textbooks, opportunities are also
created for experiential learning through outdoor classroom experiences
like learning journeys, cultural camps and the Mother Tongue Fortnight
Programme.</p>
