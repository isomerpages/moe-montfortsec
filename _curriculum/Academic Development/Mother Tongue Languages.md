**Curriculum Overview**

Our school-based curriculum adopts the following approaches and pedagogies and seeks to achieve the 21st Century Competencies by developing our Montfortians to be self-directed learners, active contributors and confident individuals. Below are some of the approaches and pedagogies adopted in our lessons:

*   Collaborative and Cooperative Learning strategies  
*   Differentiated teaching 
*   On-line teaching and learning  
*   Infusion of ICT and NE into curriculum  
*   Group project work and discussions for team building  

  

Our curriculum aims to equip and emphasize the four major aspects of language skills (Aural, Oral, Reading and Writing) to our students through EDGE programme.

  

*   Sec 1 –&nbsp;**E**ngage  
    
*   Sec 2 –&nbsp;**D**evelop  
    
*   Sec 3 –&nbsp;**G**row  
    
*   Sec 4/5 –&nbsp;**E**xcel  
   

Recognising oracy as the natural foundation for language learning, our Lower Secondary curriculum focuses more on developing oracy skills in our students. This is complemented with systematic teaching of oral vocabulary and sentence structures to develop students’ reading and writing skills. As they progress to upper secondary levels, the Upper Secondary Curriculum focuses to ensure our students are able to apply the skills they have learnt, think critically and achieve excellence in both written and spoken forms through communicating their ideas confidently.

  

**Online Learning**

To further enrich their learning experiences, online learning portals like iMTL portal and Google classroom are also extensively used for classroom learning. iMTL portal is targeted at promoting students’ interest and improve their competencies in mother tongue language through regular self-paced learning activities in an enriching web-based interactive environment. Students are able to input their thoughts and express themselves online through the hanyu pinyin input which aids them in learning oral presentation and interactive communication with the effective use of the portal during lessons.

  

**Enrichment Activities**

We seek to build up and nurture in Montfortians the ability to communicate effectively in their respective Mother Tongue languages, and expose them to numerous enrichment activities which are designed to arouse and sustain students’ interest in language learning through ICT. ICT helps to cultivate the habit of reading in students and trigger students’ interest to better appreciate ethnic culture.

Apart from teaching through the use of textbooks, opportunities are also created for experiential learning through outdoor classroom experiences like learning journeys, cultural camps and the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme.
