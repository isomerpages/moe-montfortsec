### Instructional Programme


<img src="/images/eng_prog1.png" style="width:65%">

The English Language Programme is critically conceptualised and carefully curated, anchored firmly on the principles laid out in the English Language Syllabus 2020. It is centred on the six Areas of Language Learning (AoLL), specifically, Listening and Viewing, Reading and Viewing, Speaking and Representing, Writing and Representing, Grammar and Vocabulary, and with pedagogical
emphases on Multiliteracies, Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue. These areas of learning
are encapsulated through the range of learning experiences carried out across the levels and streams.

At every level, students explore English Language learning through thematic lenses from the self and individual at sec one, to issues of global concern such as sustainability and technology at upper
secondary. They will develop all the skills necessary for communication and language competency
by interacting with rich texts and being provided with the opportunities to use and apply the
language in authentic settings, through fun and collaborative ways.

A blended pedagogical approach is taken to language learning, with a wide range of digital and
traditional resources utilised in, and out, of the classroom. Google Classrooms and Student Learning Space are part and parcel of the lived learning experience, and with their personal devices, students can explore more facets of learning, both collaboratively and independently.

To further pique the interest of our students in the English Language, alternative assessments are an indelible part of their assessment for learning. They will have platforms to apply their
knowledge and skills learnt in an authentic setting each semester; from the vlogs at secondary one, to the mini TED-talk style presentations at secondary two, students are challenged to interact with the language in a diversity of ways.

To ensure that our students broaden their perspectives, our Reading Programme is implemented at all levels of study. Students are to bring a story book to read every day before morning assembly,
enjoying the stories while acquiring the language inductively. We have class library books for loan and digital copies of The Straits Times to keep them updated on current affairs in both Singapore
and the world. Furthermore, our Read Watch and Write resources provide them with a rich resource for learning which widens their horizons and stretches their thinking. Every fortnight, reading articles and videos are shared, with insightful questions for them to reflect on, building their content knowledge and developing their critical thinking faculties.

**Literature in English (Lower Secondary)**

  

The school-based curriculum at Montfort Secondary aligns itself closely with the Literary Response Framework (see below) which seeks to promote cognitive flexibility in students.

  

In the first two years of their study, students explore the three literary genres (prose, poetry and drama) by engaging in a novel (The Boy in Striped Pyjamas), a play (Something Old, Something New and Something Borrowed) and a selection of local and international poems. Through these texts, students participate in frequent discussions about ethical, aesthetic and intellectual considerations to develop their abilities to read critically, think creatively, communicate convincingly and express eloquently.

  

The study of Literature in Montfort Secondary seeks to empower students to actively construct meaning in texts and see themselves and the world from diverse perspectives. It inspires students to empathise with others, find their own voice as they reflect on the human condition with discernment, and to consider the impact of their beliefs and actions on society.

**English Language (Upper Secondary)**

  

The key focus of the Upper Secondary Curriculum is to enable our students to apply the skills learnt and to be critical thinkers who can evaluate the purpose, credibility and reliability of the multiple texts they interact with on daily basis.

  

All students at all levels of study are strongly encouraged to bring a story book to read every day, enjoying the stories while acquiring the language inductively. We have class library books for loan and digital copies of The Straits Times to keep them updated on current affairs in both Singapore and the world. Every weekend, reading articles and videos will be emailed to them with insightful questions for them to reflect on, so as to build their content knowledge and develop their critical thinking faculties.  

  

**Literature in English (Upper Secondary)**

  

In the classroom, students explore various themes through the critical study of literary texts (films, songs, poems, prose and poems). The Literature Curriculum aims to develop students who actively construct meaning and in the process make connections between the texts, their lives and the world.

  

All Literature students will attend one play, which is usually their O Level text, once in their 2 year Literature course. Students get to interact with the director and actors after the play, which gives them the opportunity to visualise how dramatic techniques and symbols are represented on stage.
