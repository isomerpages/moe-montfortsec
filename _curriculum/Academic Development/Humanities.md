<p>To equip Montfortians for the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and
ambiguous) realities of the globalised 21st-century world, the Humanities
Department aims to cultivate critical and inquiring minds, deep disciplinary
understanding, and values that inspire them to be discerning and caring
contributors to society.</p>
<h3>Department Pedagogy</h3>
<p>Every Humanities student will be engaged in Humanities investigative tasks
(Historical Investigation, Geographical Investigation and Social Studies
Investigative Tasks) both in Lower and Upper Secondary to explore real-world
issues through inquiry, analysis, and reflection. These tasks encourage
students to ask critical questions, gather and interpret information from
various sources, and develop evidence-based conclusions.The process of
learning and deepening inquiry skills is achieved through a spiral curriculum,
curated opportunities for student-led inquiry and collaboration, use of
visible thinking routines to encourage metacognition and structured, well-paced
lessons for students to establish routines and be familiar with expectations.</p>

<p><strong>1. Spiral Curriculum from Lower Secondary to Upper Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>Key content and skills are progressively built from the lower to upper
secondary level.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary:</strong> Inference and Comparison Source-Based
Skills (History), Describe Trends, Explain Phenomena, Compare and Contrast
and Geographical Investigation (Geography)</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary:</strong> Reliability, Usefulness and Assertion
Source-Based Skills (History and Social Studies), Analysis, Assess, Evaluate
and Discuss (Geography)</p>

<p><strong>6. Meaningful Learning Experiences Beyond the Classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>Through our Humanities curriculum, we also seek to excite our Montfortians
by creating authentic learning experiences that extend beyond the classroom.
This includes programmes planned during the Learnfest periods which take
place twice a year, as well as selected competitions such as the Straits
Times Competition, NUS Geography Challenge and the War &amp; Diplomacy
History Card Game Challenge.</p>
