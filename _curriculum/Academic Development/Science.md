<h4><u>Instructional Programme</u></h4>
<p>The Montfort Secondary Science 3-eN Framework consists of 3 interweaving
rings of the school’s colours encapsulating our core mission, <strong><em>To nurture Man of Science who Inspires with Compassion and Conviction</em></strong>.
&nbsp;This revitalised mission envisions nurturing well-rounded Montfortian
who blends scientific excellence with sound values.</p>

<p><strong><u>eNdeavour</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At the pinnacle of the science department’s teaching and learning development
plan is our student talent development or science <em>Endeavour</em> programme.
The Endeavour programme aims to nurture Montfortian’s potential in leading,
applying and practicing science. Students are given opportunities to participate
in renowned competitions that challenge their scientific thinking and problem-solving
abilities, while industrial attachments provide invaluable real-world exposure
to scientific applications and research methodologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date the Tiered Endeavour programme develops talent through 2 platforms:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingenium Programme envisions the “students for students”
concept where potential student leaders and science champions are nurtured&nbsp;
through various skill-based workshops, lectures, industry attachments and
other learning journeys.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Competitions and Conference opportunities to stretch students'
potential in the sciences and nurture their 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our newly formed Tier 3 <em>Ingenium</em> programme nurtures Montfortian
with the fortitude and aptitude for science into competent science ambassadors
for the school. These young leaders will be given opportunities to attend
specialised workshops, conferences, learning journeys, future overseas
exchanges and national competitions.</p>
<p><u>Our Achievements</u>
</p>
<p>In 2022, we started out with just 22 students participating in all Tier
2 or better competitions, this year, we have 116&nbsp; students participating
in over 10 competitions.</p>

<p><strong><u>eNgagement</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Advocating the joy of learning.</em>
</p>
<p>Engaging a diverse range a students in science education requires a pedagogical
approach that transforms any space into a dynamic space where curiosity
and discovery flourish.</p>
<p>By infusing the science curriculum with &nbsp;21<sup>st</sup> century competencies
and with opportunities to practice these competencies with real world problems
&nbsp;we hope to cultivate authentic joy for scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>In addition, the science learning spaces offer opportunities for students
to take their learning beyond the classrooms and apply them in authentic
settings and explore and make use of new and emerging technologies to solve
real world problems. &nbsp;This approach moves beyond rote memorization
to embrace inquiry-based learning, where students ask questions, investigate
phenomena, construct explanations, and iterate on their ideas—mirroring
the actual practices of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>This joyful, skills-rich approach to science learning prepares students
to become innovative thinkers and informed citizens capable of addressing
the complex challenges of our rapidly evolving global society.</p>

<p><strong><u>eNrichment</u></strong>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Learning can take place anytime anywhere.</em>
</p>
<p>Our Science enrichment programmes extend learning beyond the the classroom,
embodying the principle that learning can take place anytime, anywhere.
These initiatives provide students with opportunities to explore scientific
concepts through hands-on experiences and learning journeys. By connecting
classroom theory to real-world applications, enrichment activities spark
curiosity and deepen understanding while catering to diverse learning styles
and interests.</p>

<br>Montfortian do not have far to go to develop their 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies through STEM based projects with the department’s 4 science
learning spaces.</p>
<p><strong><u>Hydroponics, </u></strong>our solar-powered hydroponics system
offer students opportunities to work with one another integrating collaborative,
adaptive thinking skills with scientific knowledge on urban farming. In
addition, students gain valuable lessons in serving the community by distributing
the harvest to neighbouring stakeholders.</p>
