<h3>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h3>
<p>1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2. The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the
foundation for strong families);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and
unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview of Montfort Secondary School's Sexuality Education Programme in 2026</h3>
<p>4. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school
curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main
themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. Click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a. Science&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly
shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet.
Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find
his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships.
The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can
be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive
maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding
the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The
need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s
ability to act responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle
adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build
a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding
of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character,
and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various
issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>At Montfort Secondary School, the following lessons from the Sexuality Education Programme will be taught in&nbsp;<u>2026</u>:</strong>

<h3>eTeens Programme</h3>
<p>8. eTeens is a programme that was developed by Health Promotion Board,
in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3
students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health
perspective. With the formation of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA)
on 1 April 2025, the programme would now be managed by CDA’s Training and
Education Division instead of HPB. eTeens is conducted in two segments
– a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome
of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed
and sensible decisions to protect themselves from sexually transmitted
infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9. Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn
that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their
family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Montfort Secondary School, the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2026:</strong>
