**BACKGROUND OF ASE PROGRAMME**  

The ASE programme was introduced in Montfort Secondary in 2016 to provide students with developmental opportunities to build Social and Emotional Competencies as well as life skills. The programme is part of the school’s overall effort to build a safe and caring environment for students to interact with their peers and teachers after school such that they may foster strong bonds and positive relationships with one another.  It also helps to develop in students, a greater sense of belonging and connectedness to the school.

A team of personnel, ranging from key personnel, teachers from various departments, student leaders from CCAs and external partners (youth workers, PSG, vendors) collaborate on a regular basis to design and implement meaningful programmes for the students in the ASE programme. The ASE team also monitors students’ attendance and behaviour, provides counselling and coaching to the students and supervises them.

**IDENTIFICATION PROCESS**

Selected students were identified to participate in the ASE programme based on interviews, counselling data and inputs from teachers. These are “latchkey” kids who exhibit low-risk emotional and behavioural issues.

**FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT**

The school created the ASE Corner in the first quarter of 2016 to provide a sanctuary for these selected students as well as students who do not have lessons after school to gather and play. The ASE students make full use of the two air hockey machines, three foosball machines, a billiard table, two carom boards and two dart boards.

**EVENTS, PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES**  

Special programmes have since been organised for students identified for the ASE programme. Some of these programmes include:
* Restorative Circles by In-house Full Time School Counsellors
* Culinary ‘Cooking with Your Senses’ by Vivarch International
*  Adventure Therapy at Boys’ Town
* 'Brorista' training and Café management by school FCE teacher
* Floorball Activity
