**Head, Hearts and Hand (2007)**

  

In engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their own learning. In engaging the “Heart”, students should connect emotionally with the Singapore story. In engaging the “Hands”, students should have opportunities to give back to society, and realise that everyone has a part to contribute to and create Singapore’s future, and, where possible, to lead in different fields of society.

**Citizenship Dispositions  (2017)**

National Education is anchored on citizenship dispositions to guide our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values as they take collective ownership of the future of the nation.
