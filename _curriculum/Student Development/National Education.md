### Mission

National Education (NE) is an integral component of Montfort Secondary School’s Character and Citizenship Education. National Education aims to instill in our students, confidence in our nation’s future and cultivate a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

**Head, Hearts and Hand (2007)**

In engaging the “Head”, students should be actively involved in their own learning. In engaging the “Heart”, students should connect emotionally with the Singapore story. In engaging the “Hands”, students should have opportunities to give back to society, and realise that everyone has a part to contribute to and create Singapore’s future, and, where possible, to lead in different fields of society.
