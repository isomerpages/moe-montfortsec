### Mission

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

### Instructional Programmes

What values do we want to see in action?

In Montfort Secondary School, students will experience both Level Specific VIA projects as well as School-Wide VIA programs. Level specific VIA projects are developmental in terms of the knowledge and skills acquired over the years. They allow more focus on the scope of involvement, which enables students to gain competencies at different levels. School-wide VIA programs provide opportunities for us to harness the collective effort of the school in contributing to various beneficiaries. 

  

<strong><u>Level Specific VIA Projects</u></strong>

VIA will organized by level (S1, S2, S3 & S4/5) with the following guidelines on the **Level (Competencies)** and **Scope ()** of involvement: **Outreach**

![](/images/outreach%20competencies.png)

The above model serves to enable Secondary Ones to know that they are able to, and have the capability to make a difference in the community that they study in (school community). In Secondary Two, the students should be able to see the impact they can have and hence, there is an innate drive to “want to serve” in order to make their neighborhood a better place for all.   

In Secondary Three, the students should have the maturity and feel empowered that they can make a change in the lives of others. This is the time when we want to engage them in a cause that is closest to their hearts – to encourage a bottom-up approach to VIA by giving them the freedom to choose a project that they wish to engage in. 

For Secondary Four/Five students, one main consideration is that this is their graduating year and we do not want to engage them in “heavily-loaded” VIA. Hence, the graduating students will play their part in participating in VIA activities organized by external organizations at a national scale.

 <strong><u>School-Wide Values-In Action Activities</u></strong>


**1\. CNY Heart Hamper Project**

  

Every class participates in the Heart Hamper Project as it is a way in which students put into practice our Montfortian values of compassion and social responsibility and extend it to the needy in our society. Classes will prepare hampers filled with essential items required by residents.  Each class will also send student volunteers to present the hampers to the needy households in the Hougang Neighbourhood.

**2\. St Gabriel's Foundation Flag Day**

  

Students participate in the St Gabriel’s Foundation Flag Day to collect donations for the foundation. Together with the support of our Parent Support Group (PSG) and school staff, students go out to different locations and speak about the good work of the St Gabriel's Foundation.

**3\. Hair for Hope** 

  

Hair for Hope is an annual event where staff, students, and their family members participate in to show support for children from the Children Cancer Foundation (CCF) who are cancer patients. Participants will shave their hair and make a BALD statement to create awareness of childhood cancer in Singapore. The act of shaving tells children with cancer that it is OK to be bald and raise funds and help children with cancer and their families.

**4\. Overseas Values In Action Project** 

  

During our trip to Chiang Mai, our students had the opportunity to interact with students from Montfort College, our brother school in Chiang Mai. 

Our students served at Care Corner Orphanage, helping to set the foundation for a new playground and to paint a wall mural in one of the dormitories. They also bonded with the children through games and activities. On the second last day, the team went to a nearby secondary school to conduct English lessons, teaching them how to show their appreciation to their friends in English! 

As always, our trip to Chiang Mai is a lesson in humility, respect and compassion. We are indeed blessed to have had the opportunity to grow our world view and apply what is taught in the class to real-life situations!
