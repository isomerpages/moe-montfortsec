### Mission

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community. As part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.

### Instructional Programmes

In Montfort Secondary School, students will experience both Level Specific VIA projects as well as School-Wide VIA programs. Level specific VIA projects are developmental in terms of the knowledge and skills acquired over the years. They allow more focus on the scope of involvement, which enables students to gain competencies at different levels. School-wide VIA programs provide opportunities for us to harness the collective effort of the school in contributing to various beneficiaries.
