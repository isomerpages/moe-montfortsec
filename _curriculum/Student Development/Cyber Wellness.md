### Mission

To focus on developing the childâ€™s instinct to protect himself and others online as well as to empower him to take responsibility for his own wellbeing in cyberspace.

To equip our students with life-long social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe, respectful and responsible users of ICT.

### Instructional Programme

Every student will have to go through 4-5 lessons on Cyber Wellness on themes including Cyber Use, Cyber Identity, Cyber Relationship and Cyber Citizenship. The focus this year will be on Cyber Wellness and mental heath.

As part of our efforts to bring about a greater awareness about Cyber Wellness, we have arranged the following programmes to achieve the desired student outcomes.

<u><strong>Cyber Wellness Week</strong></u>

**Hall Assembly program on Cyber Wellness** 

A talk in which a video clip on Cyber Bullying jointly created by our Cyber Wellness student ambassadors and a vendor will be displayed. 

**Cyber Wellness Carnival** 

Our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors will set up booths at the canteen with games and quiz stations, exploring cyber wellness. We have intentionally created platforms for our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to demonstrate leadership qualities. In addition, this allows us to better engage the student and staff population through these exciting and educational activities.
