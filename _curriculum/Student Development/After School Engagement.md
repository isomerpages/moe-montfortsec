<p><strong>About the After-School Engagement (ASE) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The After-School Engagement (ASE) programme was launched at Montfort Secondary
in 2016 to offer meaningful activities and support for students. This initiative
is part of the school’s commitment to fostering a safe and caring environment
where students can connect with their peers and teachers, building stronger
bonds and positive relationships.</p>
<p>Through the ASE programme, students have access to developmental opportunities
designed to enhance their social-emotional competencies and interpersonal
skills, nurturing a deeper sense of school connectedness and belonging.</p>
<p><strong>Programmes and Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>ASE sessions are conducted every Tuesday and Thursday (excluding Home-Based
Learning days). Our dedicated teachers collaborate with community partners
to design engaging and tailored sessions that meet the needs of our students.
