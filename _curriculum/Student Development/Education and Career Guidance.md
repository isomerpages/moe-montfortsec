### Vision
To develop resilient Montfortians who are empowered to plan for his post-secondary education and career options in his journey of lifelong learning.

### Mission
To enable Montfortians to draw connections between their subjects, interests and passions with higher education pathways and the world of work.

### Overview
Our ECG programme seeks to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make decisions for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to plan and manage their career pathways and learning throughout their lives. 

Montfortians are encouraged to strive towards a higher education pathway and a career which they can aspire to. Their journeys in lifelong learning continue at Montfort Secondary School where ECG experiences are designed to inspire them to become their best self and turn their dreams into reality.
