To enable Montfortians to draw connections between their subjects, interests and passions with higher education pathways and the world of work.

Montfortians are encouraged to strive towards a higher education pathway and a career which they can aspire to. Their journeys in lifelong learning continue at Montfort Secondary School where ECG experiences are designed to inspire them to become their best self and turn their dreams into reality.
