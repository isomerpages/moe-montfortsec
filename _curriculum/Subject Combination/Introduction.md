<h3><strong><u>Sec 3 Subject Combination 2025 for Sec 2 students in 2024</u></strong></h3>
<p>Every Montfortian will participate in the Sec 3 Subject Combination Exercise
after the Sec 2 year-end examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;exercise allows every Montfortian&nbsp;to indicate his&nbsp;preferred
subject combinations based on academic merit as demonstrated in the overall
academic performance at Sec&nbsp;2 and interest in subjects offered.</p>
<p>All subject combinations offered will pave the way for students to pursue
post-secondary courses at various&nbsp;tertiary&nbsp;educational institutions
including Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, and the Institutes of Technical
Education.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Choosing Subject Combination</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important to take into account the following factors,</p>
<p>(a) His specific interests,
<br>(b) Ability to cope with the subjects selected,
<br>(c) Alignment with his future post-secondary options.</p>
<p>There is no “best” or “most prestigious” subject combination that a Montfortian
should opt for. Instead, the primary consideration should be to choose
a subject combination which is most ideal for himself according to his
interests, aptitude and aspiration for post-secondary education.</p>
