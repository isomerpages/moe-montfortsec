<strong>Tips for Choosing Subject Combination</strong>

It is important to take into account the following factors,

(a) His specific interests,    
(b) Ability to cope with the subjects selected,   
(c) Alignment with his future post-secondary options. 

There is no “best” or “most prestigious” subject combination that a Montfortian should opt for. Instead, the primary consideration should be to choose a subject combination which is most ideal for himself according to his interests, aptitude and aspiration for post-secondary education.
