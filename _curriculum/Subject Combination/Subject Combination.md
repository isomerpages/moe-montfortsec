### <strong><u>Sec 3 Subject Combination 2024</u></strong>

Every Montfortian will participate in the Sec 3 Subject Combination Exercise after the Sec 2 year-end examinations. 

This exercise provides an opportunity for every Montfortian to indicate his preferred subject combinations based on academic merit as demonstrated in the overall academic performance at Sec 2 and interest in subjects offered. 

All subject combinations offered will pave the way for students to pursue post-secondary courses at the various tertiary educational institutions including Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, and the Institutes of Technical Education.

We aim to provide information that could possibly help you and your child make an informed choice. The page is organised as follows:

* the list of subjects offered in each stream;</li>
<li>the eligibility criteria for the pure sciences combination, pure humanities combination and elective subjects;</li>
<li>the Information of Secondary 3 subjects;</li>
<li>the information of his post-secondary education pathways.

<strong>Tips for Choosing Subject Combination</strong>

It is important to take into account the following factors,

(a) His specific interests,    
(b) Ability to cope with the subjects selected,   
(c) Alignment with his future post-secondary options. 

There is no “best” or “most prestigious” subject combination that a Montfortian should opt for. Instead, the primary consideration should be to choose a subject combination which is most ideal for himself according to his interests, aptitude and aspiration for post-secondary education.
