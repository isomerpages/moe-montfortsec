<h3>What is MSPEX?</h3>
<p>The Montfort Sports Excellence (MSPEX) Programme is a multi-module sports
excellence program developed for school sports representatives from both
Montfort Schools, in alignment with the One Montfort philosophy towards
developing student athletes.</p>
<p>The programme uses age appropriate and developmentally sound approaches
that will provide strong fundamentals and promotes the holistic development
of the student athletes based on sports science education such as sports
psychology, fitness and conditioning, diet and nutrition and injury prevention
and management.</p>
<p>The programme started off focussing on two sports that both schools excelled
in: badminton, football, followed by softball in 2023. In 2024, the programme
has expanded to include other sports such as rugby, wushu and basketball
and performing arts CCAs such as band and chorale. These CCAs participated
in The Mindset of Champions workshops. In 2025, the badminton and softball
team has also started on the Mental Toughness Small Group Coaching Programme,
focussing on onsite training observation and feedback.</p>
