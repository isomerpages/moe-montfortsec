### What is MSPEX?
  
The Montfort Sports Excellence (MSPEX) Programme is a multi-module sports excellence programme, developed particularly for sports representatives from both Montfort Schools which is in alignment with the One Montfort philosophy that strives to nurture our student athletes.  
  
The programme adopts age-appropriate and sound approaches that aim to provide strong fundamentals and promote the holistic development of the student athletes based on sports science education that comprises sports psychology, fitness and conditioning, diet and nutrition, and injury prevention and management.  
  
For a start, the programme will focus on two sports that both schools have excelled in: Badminton and Football. The programme hopes to include all other sports offered in these schools in the near future.
