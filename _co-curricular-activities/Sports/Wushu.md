Montfort Wushu aims to build a rugged, robust and disciplined team of athletes with an interest in the ancient Chinese martial art of self-defence. Wushu is more than just a martial art. It is a reflection of centuries of culture, wisdom and philosophy. From the serene movement of Tai Chi to the lightning-fast strikes of Shaolin Kung Fu, each encapsulates a unique blend of strength, agility and harmony. The main key events include Lunar New Year performance, Founders' Day performance, Values-In-Action (VIA) performance and participation in yearly National School Games (NSG) Wushu Championship.
