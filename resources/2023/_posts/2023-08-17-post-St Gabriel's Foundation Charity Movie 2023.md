In support of the Programmes and operations of St Gabriel's Foundation (SGF). St Gabriel's Foundation was set up to take care of 6 MOE-aided schools (Assumption English, Assumption Pathway, Montfort Junior & Secondary, St Gabriel's Primary & Secondary) and 1 social service agency (Boys' Town). The Foundation has educational programmes across all 7 institutions which are founded on the values of our Founder, St Louis de Montfort. There are standalone programmes (leadership, value in action, confidence building, friendship, building resilience, etc), as well as integrating the values of our Founder into the curriculum and school experiences for our students.
