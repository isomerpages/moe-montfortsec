Dear 2022 Sec 4NA&4NT Montfortians

1. Please be informed that the N Level results will be released in **mid-December (date to be advised)** 
2. You are expected to report in **full school uniform and groomed according to the standards as laid out in the Praise and Grace Journal for the collection of result slips**. (No inappropriate hairstyle or coloured hair). You will not be allowed into the school until grooming is rectified. Please note that due to COVID-19 restrictions, only students receiving their results will be allowed into the school. 
3. Your parents/ guardian may drop you off if they are driving but **will not be allowed** to park or wait in school. This will help to minimise the crowd in school and we seek your parents’/ guardians’ kind understanding on this matter.
