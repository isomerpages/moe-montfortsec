Dear Montfortians  
  
Please be informed that the **N-Level results will be released in mid-December**. You are expected to report to school in full school uniform and groomed according to the standards as laid out in the Praise and Grace Journal for the collection of result slips. (No inappropriate hairstyle or coloured hair). You will not be allowed into the school until grooming is rectified.  
  
Please note that due to COVID-19 restrictions, only students receiving their results will be allowed into the school. Your parent/guardian may drop you off if they are driving but will not be allowed to park or wait in school. This will help to minimise the crowd in school and we seek your parents’/ guardians’ kind understanding on this matter.
