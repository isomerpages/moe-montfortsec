##### Dear 2023 Sec 4N(A) &amp; 4N(T) Montfortians,  
         
1\. Please be informed that the N-Level results will be released on 18 December 2023 (Monday), 2 pm.

2\. **You are expected to report to School Hall at 1.45 pm in full school uniform and groomed according to the standards laid out in the Praise and Grace Journal for the collection of result slips.** **No inappropriate hairstyle or coloured hair. You will not be allowed into the school until your grooming is rectified.**

3\. Your parent/guardian may accompany you to collect your results. If your parent/guardian is driving, please ask him/her to park at the nearby HDB carparks around the school.

4\. Those who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect their results. Those who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the schoolâ€™s verification when collecting the results. Students may contact their class mentors for assistance with the appointment of a proxy.
