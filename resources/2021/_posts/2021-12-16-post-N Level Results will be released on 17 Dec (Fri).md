1.  You are expected to report to your classroom at **1.45pm in full school uniform and groomed according to the standards as laid out in the Praise and Grace Journal for the collection of result slips**. (No inappropriate hairstyle or coloured hair). You will not be allowed into the school until grooming is rectified. Please note that due to COVID-19 restrictions, only students receiving their results will be allowed into the school. Your parents/ guardian may drop you off if they are driving but **will not be allowed** to park or wait in school. This will help to minimise the crowd in school and we seek your parents’/ guardians’ kind understanding on this matter.  
      
    
2.  **Students who have been issued the MOH's Health Risk Warning**  
    You will only be allowed to collect your results in person if you are tested negative using the ART test kit on the day of the results release, before going to school. You are to send the results (with name and date written on the **ART** device) to your class mentors before leaving for school.  
      
    
3.  **Students who are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result**  
    You should not return to school to collect your results.  You may check your results online via **Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal** at [www.seab.gov.sg](https://www.seab.gov.sg/) from 3.15pm on 17 December 2021. School candidates who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates Portal. School candidates who are International Students will receive their system-generated username via email from 14 December 2021. SEAB’s Candidates Portal will be accessible from 17 December 2021 to 31 December 2021. We wish you all the best for your results!
