<p>Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by Ministry of Education
(MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple
administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes
and activities. This enables parents to better support their child in their
education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools.</p>
