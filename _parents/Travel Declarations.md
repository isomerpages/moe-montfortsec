Dear Parents/Guardians

As part of emergency management to safeguard your son/ward's health and that of all students and staff in the school, students are required to declare their travel plans for the upcoming holidays.


We seek the cooperation of parents/guardians to exercise social responsibilities by making accurate travel declaration.

Please update your travel plans for the upcoming holidays throughÂ **Parents Gateway App**.

Enjoy your holidays!
